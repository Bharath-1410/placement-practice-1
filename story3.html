            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>The group stages have concluded in Qatar 2022. With 48 of the 64 games, or 3/4th of the tournament played, and just hours left to the knockout rounds, here are my reflections so far.
                </p>
                <h4>Asian teams have delighted</h4>
                <p>Excluding the hosts, 3 out the 5 qualifying teams from the Asian Federation reached the knockout rounds, which is a first. Asian teams have come in without any airs, played with heart and determination, and provided some all-time great upsets.
                </p>
                <h4>Brazil is football</h4>
                <p>No team lights up a World Cup like Brazil. Their history, fans and iconic canary yellow jerseys are legendary. On top of that, their red-hot talent and samba style, exemplified by Richarlison’s scissor kick, is a welcome contrast to the cold mechanistical tactical approaches of fellow “top” teams.</p>
                <h4>Hosts qualification</h4>
                <p>Qatar became the first host to lose all 3 group games. While Qatar was awarded the World Cup controversially, I think all hosts should have a minimum “history” in the game, maybe like at least one quarterfinal in the last 20 years or so. Otherwise, the host nation has nothing to look forward to and the benefits of hosting are diminished.</p>
                <h4>Time to ban heading</h4>
                <p>We’ve seen some sickening head clashes in Qatar 2022. Many studies are coming forward about the serious mental and physical harms of heading. It’s time for football to take a bold step and ban heading. It is foot-ball after all! Headers may seem an integral part of the game, but football is possible without them. My earlier piece has an elaboration.</p>
                <h4>Environmentalism and football make great companions</h4>
                <p>A great sight for me was the Save the Planet armbands. Football is a global game. Climate change and the associated issues of habitat destruction and environmental degradation are global crises. The environment is a maximally inclusive cause, going beyond humans even to animals, fish and flora. The Beautiful Game uniting us for a worthwhile cause. A great match!</p>
