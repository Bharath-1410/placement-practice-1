            <p>Well, the final games of the NBA regular season have been played and the playoff match-ups are set. Dissapointingly, due to injury and just luck (or lack of luck) of the draw, the first round is not as exciting as it could have been. That isn’t to say that there is nothing worth watching. <br> <br>

                Lets go through each, starting with the riveting match-up of the First seeded Bucks and the Eighth seeded Orlando Magic.
            </p>
            <h4>Bucks v Magic - 4–0</h4>
            <p>It’s going to be a sweep. The Bucks would win. Hell, they could probably rest Antetokounmpo and still lose no more than a game. The Bucks are a great team and Orlando just aren’t. With Isaac out, their chances of putting up a fight have lessened even more.
                    <br><br>
                I don’t mean to sound harsh but the Bucks had the Leagues best defensive rating and the eighth best offensive rating. The Magic, meanwhile, are twenty-third in Offensive rating and eleventh in defensive rating. These are all fancy ways of saying the Bucks are bound for the Finals and the Magic are happy they made the playoffs. Sweep.</p>
            <h4>Raptors v Nets - 4–0</h4>
            <p>Yep. Don’t pack away the brooms yet. There’s another sweep coming.
                <br><br>
                The Nets, even with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving out of the Roster would put up a fight against the Raptors. However, with Spencer Dinwiddie, Wilson Chandler, Deandre Jordan and Taurean Prince all out, it is the Caris LeVert show for Brooklyn and while he is fun to watch and will put up a lot of points, it won’t be enough against the reigning Champs.</p>
            <h4>Celtics v Raptors - 4–2</h4>
            <p>Oh, what could have been. Once again it’s the Celtics coming up against the 76ers. The first Eastern Conference series the I am actually looking forward to watching. <br> <br>

                Alas, the Sixers will be without their Star, All-Defence Point-Forward Ben Simmons. I’m sure you have all heard that Simmons and Embiid don’t work together but the fact is they are worse without Simmons, especially defensively. Simmons won’t be there to slow down the Celtics All-star Forward Jason Tatum and the Boston Collection of Walker, Tatum and Brown will have a field day. <br> <br>
                
                Embiid is still playing though, and at his best will be by far the best player on the Court. Along with Harris, Embiid could win his team at least 2 games. This series will be a good one.</p>
            <h4>Heat v Pacers - 4–1</h4>
            <p>Yet another series tainted by injuries, this one would have been one to have your eyes glued to the screen for. <br> <br>

                Pacers All-Star Domantis Sabonis is out along with Jeremy Lamb. Myles Turner will miss the first game of the series and TJ Warren is Day-To-Day with a foot injury. If the Pacers were healthy, this series could go all seven games. However, they are a scrappy, skilful, well-coached team that won’t go down without a fight. Plus, TJ Warren vs Jimmy Butler. <br> <br>
                
                Heat should beat them in a Gentlemen’s sweep. Pacers could steal a game or two.</p>
            <h4>Lakers vs Blazers - 4–1</h4>
            <p>Can we PLEASE stop talking about how the Lakers are scared of facing the Blazers. Or how the bLazers will be trouble for the Lakers. Seriously. <br> <br>

                Yes. Damian Lillard is fantastic and the Blazers have been much better since Nurkic’ return but come on. The Blazers had the Twenty-Seventh best defensive rating in the league. The FOURTH worst. While they did have the third best offensive rating, it won’t be enough against the best team in the West. <br> <br>
                
                Lebron James and Anthony Davis are questions the Blazers have no answer for and they will make quick work of the Eighth seeded Portland team. ‘Dame Time’ may steal a game. This series is going no more than five. <br> <br>
                
                That was a feisty write up, sorry. NBA Twitter is annoying.</p>
            <h4>Rockets v Thunder - 4–3</h4>
            <p>Hereeee we go. Finally. A series that I really hope lives up to expectation. Four vs Five. Harden vs Paul. Westbrook vs his old team. <br> <br>

                There are just so many aspects of this series, apart from two really good, fun teams opposing each other, that makes it so interesting. Can the small ball Rockets run Steven Adams off the floor? Can Adams punish them for going small? Unfortunately, Westbrook will be out for at least the “start” of the first round. Whatever that means. A tough series for the Rockets got even more difficult. <br> <br>
                
                Hoping this series goes as long as possible. Harden will inevitably be too strong. Rockets winning in seven.</p>
