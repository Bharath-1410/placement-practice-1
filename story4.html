                <h4>PKL Final Puneri Paltan vs Haryana Steelers Live Score: Paltan crowned champions</h4>
                <p>Puneri Paltan 28-25 Haryana Steelers :<br>
    
                    Nearly a sacre for the Puneri side as they give two points away. However, they have recovered well and it is still a five-point lead to the team with possibly two more raids to come. A single point has been gifted by Sankte Sawant and it is 28-14 to the Paltan with the last raid coming. <br> <br>
                    Puneri Paltan have been crowned champions here and history repeats itself as it is once again a team which lost in the final of the previous season and went on to win the final of the next.

                <h4>PKL Final Puneri Paltan vs Haryana Steelers Live Score: One minute to go</h4>
                <p>Puneri Paltan 28-21 Haryana Steelers :
                    <br>
                    With just a minute to go, the game is going Puneriâ€™s way as they lead 28-21 and only a blunder can get the trophy away from the team from Maharashtra. </p>
                <h4>PKL Final Puneri Paltan vs Haryana Steelers Live Score: Pune defence gelling well</h4>
                <p>Puneri Paltan 26-20 Haryana Steelers : <br>
                    The Pune defence is so trite that they are not letting the Haryana Steelers score freely and as a result with only two and a half minutes to go, they lead by six points still and it could be more than handy in the final. </p>
                <h4>PKL Final Puneri Paltan vs Haryana Steelers Live Score: Time-Out</h4>

                    <br>
                    A strategic time-out has been taken here and Haryana has leapt their way back into the game. Trailing 14-21 at one point, they are now trailing by just six points and it could have well been seven if not for the defender to make a mistake and give a point to the Pune team. 10 minutes to go now. </p>
